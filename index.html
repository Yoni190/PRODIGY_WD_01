        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Our journey began with a simple yet profound realization: coffee has the power to connect, inspire, and elevate our daily lives. From our humble beginnings as a small local roastery, we’ve grown into a beloved brand known for our meticulous sourcing, expert roasting, and unwavering dedication to freshness.

            At Buna House, every cup of coffee tells a story. Our founders, who spent years traveling to coffee-growing regions and learning from local farmers, bring a deep appreciation for the artistry and craft behind each bean. We partner with ethical farms and cooperatives to ensure that our beans are grown with respect for the environment and fair treatment of the farmers.
